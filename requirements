A: library of hdl primitives

B: palette of xcos blocks matching primitives
  - function to construct library from config file allowing diffs of 

C: ability to pass parameters from xcos blocks to hdl primitives
	- single values
	- vectors

D: script to generate HDL from xcos diagram
	1: type propagation
    1:  every port has an associated width, binary point and data type
        parameter (TODO vectors).
    2:  input port's type, width are determined by input link.
    3:  some blocks have explicit output types, others have output types
        determined implicitly from input types.

	2: links between primitives
	3: hierachy
	4: clocks
	5: external inputs

E: simulation from xcos environment
	- type propagation
